            stay organized, and take on any task. Its clear, simple design just
            makes sense â€” especially if you have an iPhone. So things like
            managing multiple windows and keeping track of your files are a
            breeze.

            In the manufacturing process, the silver color requires no dye to
            the body of the keyboard; this keyboard has to undergo a dyeing
            process which gives it the space gray color, making it more
            expensive to manufacture.
